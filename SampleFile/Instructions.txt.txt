Note :

Considerations:
This program could have been console app or with visual window based.I decided to go with the simplest 
of its forms as it feels that this will be used mostly as a script than somebody manually selecting 
the path to a program.

Hence,
This is how I expect this program to be run on PROD.

A filewatcher will monitor incomming flat file,which will kick off an event on automation softwares
like Automic UC4,that will run a batch script command to run the EXE file.

The EXE(console application) file will be looking for Files in  "C:\\SampleFile\\" with name :
"samplefile.txt". So,effectively the full file patch should be "C:\\SampleFile\\samplefile.txt".

After it receives the file,
It will use the algorithm,"State Machine", to produce the new TEXT file with output containing what user
selected .
For convenience,the file is stored in the same folder "SampleFile",but we send this to any location we want.

Now,we can use this to train other modules as files are produced that can be moved around and tested.

The Output file produced has this format : "UserOutput_{Ticks(This is large number)}",and is produced on same folder.


PS:
If there were some software that could capture traversal information,
I am curious if we can use Graph Theory to find most optiminum way of arranging the number and letters 
so that the traversal is minimum.Some letters are rarely used and some are used frequently.
This is what I meant by training earlier,we can get what is produced frequently and understand if arrangement 
of the letters can be better for less travel.
